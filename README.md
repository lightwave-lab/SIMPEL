# SIMPEL
SImulation Model for Photonic Excitable Lasers

This open-source project is based on the work of researchers in the Lightwave Communications Lab, Princeton University.
The initial code is under final stage of development and will be made available after the main publication is scrutinized by a peer-reviewed journal.

Developers involved in the project so far:
- Thomas Ferreira de Lima

Research publications involved in the project:
- Bhavin J. Shastri, Mitchell A. Nahmias, Alexander N. Tait, Ben Wu, and Paul R. Prucnal, "SIMPEL: Circuit model for photonic spike processing laser neurons," Opt. Express 23, 8029-8044 (2015)
